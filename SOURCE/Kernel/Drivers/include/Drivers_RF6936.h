* TX Control register
* -------------------------------------------------------------
* all - R/W
* 7    TX_GO - Transmit Enable. Setting this bit triggers the transmission of
*      a packet.  Writing a 0 to this flag has no effect. This bit is cleared
*      automatically at the end of packet transmission.
*
*      The TX buffer may be loaded [before or] after setting this bit. If data
*      is loaded after setting this bit, the length of time available to load
*      the buffer depends on the starting state (sleep, idle or synth), the
*      length of the SOP code and the packet data rate. For example, if
*      starting from idle mode on a fast channel in 8DR mode with 32 chip SOP
*      codes the time available is 100us (synth start) + 64us (SOP length) +
*      32us (length byte) = 196us. If there are no bytes in the TX buffer at
*      the end of transmission of the length field, an underflow IRQ will
*      occur.
* 6    TX_CLR - Clear TX Buffer. Writing a 1 to this register clears the TX
*      buffer and associated error flags.  Writing a 0 to this bit has no
*      effect. The previous packet may be re-transmitted by setting TX_GO and
*      not setting this bit.  When not re-transmitting data currently in the TX
*      buffer, TX_GO may be set at the same time or any time after TX_CLR is
*      set.
*
*      If the TX buffer is to be loaded after the TX_GO bit has been set, then
*      TX_CLR should be set when TX_GO is set.
*      If the TX buffer is to be loaded before the TX_GO bit has been set,
*      then TX_CLR must be set before loading the data.
*
*      Note: TX_GO does not clear under-run, only TX_CLR does.
*
* For the following bits see TX_IRQ register for IRQ function description.
* 5    TXB15_IRQ_EN    - Buffer Not Full Interrupt Enable.
* 4    TXB8_IRQ_EN     - Buffer Half Empty Interrupt Enable.
* 3    TXB0_IRQ_EN     - Buffer Empty Interrupt Enable.
* 2    TXBERR_IRQ_EN   - TX Buffer Under-run/overflow Interrupt Enable.
* 1    TXC_IRQ_EN      - Transmission Complete Interrupt Enable.
* 0    TXE_IRQ_EN      - Transmit Error Interrupt Enable.

* bit is also set.
*
* all - R
* 7    Oscillator Stable IRQ Status. This bit is set when the internal crystal
*      oscillator is stable. This bit is set whenever the oscillator is stable.
* 6    Low Voltage Interrupt Status. This bit is set when the voltage on Vadcref
*      is below the LVI threshold.  It is cleared whenever the Vadcref voltage is
*      above the LVI threshold.
* 5    Buffer Not Full Interrupt Status. This bit is set whenever there are 15
*      or fewer bytes remaining in the transmit buffer, and cleared otherwise.
* TODO: SYO wordsmith TXB8 - also change names from "full", empty, etc.
* 4    Buffer Half Empty Interrupt Status. This bit is set whenever there are 8
*      or fewer bytes remaining in the transmit buffer, and cleared otherwise.
* 3    Buffer Empty Interrupt Status. This bit is set at any time that the
*      transmit buffer is empty, and cleared whenever there are any bytes
*      present in the buffer.
* 2    TX Buffer Error Interrupt Status. This IRQ is triggered in one of two
*      ways.  1. When the number of bytes remaining to be transmitted is
*      greater than 0 and the transmit buffer is empty when the TX state
*      machine tries to fetch the next byte for transmission.  2. When the
*      TX buffer is full and there is an attempt to write data to the TX
*      buffer.  Setting TX_CLR bits clears this flag.
* 1    Transmission Complete Interrupt Status. This IRQ is triggered when
*      transmission is complete.  If transaction mode is enabled, this
*      interrupt is triggered only when an ACK is correctly received. If
*      transaction mode is not enabled then this interrupt is triggered
*      immediately after transmission of the last bit of the CRC. This bit is
*      cleared when this register is read.
* 0    Error Interrupt Status. This IRQ is triggered when there is an error in
*      transmission. This interrupt is only applicable to Transaction Mode. It
*      is triggered whenever no valid ACK packet is received within the ACK
*      timeout period. Reading this register clears this bit.

*      bit.

*      bit enables the LNA; clearing this bit disables the LNA.
* 5    ATT - Receive Attenuator Enable. Setting this bit enables the receiver
*      attenuator. The Receiver Attenuator may be used to de-sensitize the
*      receiver so that only very strong signals may be received.
* 4    HILO - When HILO_EN is set, this bit is used to select whether the device
*      will use the high frequency for the channel selected, or the low
*      frequency.  1 = hi; 0= lo.
*      When HILO_EN is not enabled this also controls the highlow bit to the
*      receiver and should be left at the default value of 1 for high side RX
*      injection.
* 3    HILO_EN - HiLo Mode Enable. When this bit is set, the HiLo bit in the
*      Channel register determines whether the device receives data transmitted
*      1MHz above the RX Synthesizer frequency or 1MHz below the RX Synthesizer
*      frequency. Use of this mode allows for very fast turn-around, because
*      the same synthesizer frequency may be used for both transmit and
*      receive, thus eliminating the synthesizer re-settling period between
*      transmit and receive. Note that when this bit is set, and the HiLo bit
*      is cleared, received data bits are automatically inverted to compensate
*      for the inversion of data received on the "image" frequency.
* 1    RXOW_EN - Overwrite Enable. When this bit is set, if an SOP is detected
*      while there RX buffer is not empty, then the existing contents of RX
*      buffer are lost, and the new packet is loaded into the RX buffer.  When
*      this bit is set, the RXOW_IRQ is enabled.
*      If this bit is cleared, then the RX buffer may not be over-written by a
*      new packet, and whenever the RX buffer is not empty SOP conditions are
*      ignored, and it is not possible to receive data until the previously
*      received packet has been completely read from the RX buffer.
* 0    VLD_EN - Valid Flag Enable. When this bit is set, the receive buffer can
*      store only 8 bytes of data.  The other half of the buffer is used to
*      store valid flags.  See RX_BUFFER for more detail.

* The Power Management Unit (PMU) provides a boost converter to generate

* falls below the minimum voltage required by these blocks. The PMU can also
* provide power to external devices. In order to provide maximum flexibility,
* the PMU output voltage is programmable, so that device requiring voltages
* higher than the LS2 minimum can be powered from the PMU.
*
* all - R/W
* 7    PMU_EN - PMU Enable (!pmuoff). Setting this bit enables the PMU. When
*      the PMU
*      is disabled, or if the PMU is enabled and the Vadcref voltage is above the
*      value set in Bits 1:0 of this register, the Vout pin is internally
*      connected to the Vadcref pin. If the PMU is enabled and the Vadcref voltage
*      is below the value set by PMU_OUTV, then the PMU will boost the Vout
*      pin to a voltage not less than the value set by PMU_OUTV.
*      Clearing PMU_SEN causes this bit to have no effect.
*  TODO BR doc says: When pmuoff is asserted, this bit disables the PMU and
*      isolates VBAT from VREG
* 6    LV_IRQ_EN - Low Voltage Interrupt Enable. Setting this bit enables the
*      Low Voltage Interrupt. When this interrupt is enabled, if the Vadcref
*      voltage falls below the value set by LVITH of this register, then a low
*      voltage interrupt will be generated. Unless bit 5 of this register is
*      also set, the LVI IRQ will be automatically disabled when the device is
*      in Sleep Mode.
* 5    PMU_SEN - PMU Enabled in Sleep Mode. If this bit is set, the PMU will
*      continue to operate normally when the device is in Sleep Mode. If this
*      bit is not set, then the PMU is disabled when the device is in Sleep
*      Mode. In this case, if Vadcref is below the PMU_OUTV voltage and PMU_EN is
*      set when the device enters Sleep Mode the Vout voltage is fall to the
*      Vadcref voltage as the Vout capacitors discharge.
*      Verification notes: pmuoff = PMU_SEN ? !PMU_EN : vdigoff;

*      transmission of the ACK packet, the device the automatically transitions
*      to the END STATE. When this bit is cleared, the device transitions
*      directly to the END STATE immediately after the end of packet
*      transmission.
* 5    FRC_END_STATE - Force a transition to the state set in END_STATE.
*      This bit is automatically cleared upon completion.
